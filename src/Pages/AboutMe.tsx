        <p>
          My name is Emmanuel Su√°rez, I am currently pursuing an Electrical
          Engineering degree at UdelaR. Since my early school days, I've been
          driven by an insatiable curiosity, always eager to explore and learn
          about a wide range of subjects that goes from math, and programming,
          all the way to designing, sketching, thinking about solutions.This
          journey has led me to a multitude of interests and skills, and it's
          the process of learning and working towards something that brings me
          the greatest fulfillment. I've built this website from scratch,
          developed a portfolio of projects, and dedicated countless hours to
          self-improvement through independent learning and formal courses.
