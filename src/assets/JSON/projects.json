It's also a great way to experiment with different layouts and technologies. For example, I've been using Tailwind CSS to style my projects lately, and don't get me wrong, it's great, but to be honest with you guys I've been watching too much of Kevin Powell and I got inspired to write my own classes and styles.",

You enter your birthday, time and location and it will provide you with the planets and what signs they were in the moment you were born. It's still in development but I'm planning on adding a lot of features.",
