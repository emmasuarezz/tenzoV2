It's still in development, but I'm really excited about it. I'm learning a lot of new things. I hope I can finish it soon, so I can share it with you guys. I'm sure you'll love it!",

It was a great introduction to React and the ones who mentored us were really good, they were always there to help us and answer our questions. I hope I can attend another one of these camps in the future, because they are really helpful, I did this website using all the knowledge I got from the camp and I'm really proud of it. I hope you like it too!",
