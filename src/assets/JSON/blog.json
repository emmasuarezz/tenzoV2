It's still in development, but I'm really excited about it. I'm learning a lot of new things. I hope I can finish it soon, so I can share it with you guys. I'm sure you'll love it!",

It was a great introduction to React, we had little projects week by week, and our mentors were always there to help and answer our questions. I had an incredible experience and left wanting to learn more, it really provided me with enough insight to catch up easily with the topics we didn't cover, like TypeScript. I did this website using all the knowledge I got from the camp and I'm really proud of it.",
